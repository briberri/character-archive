            <br>Cause of death: 
            <br>Sexual Preference: Pansexual 
            <br>Relationship Status: Married to DL 
            <br>Occupation: Mafia boss / Company CEO 
            <br>Origin: Puerto Rico 
            <br>Current Residence: 
            <br>Languages spoken: Spanish (native language), English (mastered) Body marks: None 
            <br><br>Backstory: Zatch's parents were mafia bosses, as was the rest of his family. His parents owned a company
            that produced technology and other tech parts, so most of their wealth came from their business. For the sake of the company, they kept their mob life and their CEO life sperate, and prepared Zatch to take over once he was of age. Zatch received
            a good education and took and interest in robotics and computers. Zatch started fiddling around and created many robots, many of which were just early failed prototype. His first successful robot was an AI that hooked up to a computer and
            did various actions (stored files, looked things up, execute commands) and shared his creation with his parents. 
            <br><br>Ecstatic, they allowed Zatch to work with the other engineers and he produced the robots under his name. While they did very well,
            there were several other companies that wanted the AI to create their own, better versions as Zatch continued working on other robots. Another company hired a rival mafia gang to steal the blueprint data for the AI. However, the members went
            too far and ended up killing Zatch (and his pet cat, Nano), but the blueprints were auto-deleted by the system protection service Zatch installed.
            <br><br>The mob members decided to burn everything before running off, and the sparks that were generated
            during the fire electrocuted Zatch's body. Something in the system glitched, and Zatch was stored inside that computer and transferred somewhere on the cloud online. Zatch slept for several years after that until he finally awoken and returned
            to the company.
            <br><br>Personality: Zatch is usually laid-back when given free time, and pretty smart. He's usually rather careful when he leaves home, as he can't have too many bodyguards around him at once but also can't be recognizable outdoors.
            Despite his predecessors, Zatch isn't as bloodthirsty as most other mob bosses are, and isn't too quick to kill. Special Abilities: Electric field manipulation, electroreception (the user senses the weak bioelectric fields generated by living
            beings and uses it to locate them), bio-electricity manipulation (the user can manipulate bio-electric currents that exist within all aspects of the body existing in the nervous system, heart and muscles).</p>

                    <li>Kibi likes science a lot, and spends almost all of her
            time working with the other engineers and helping them develop more robots. Zatch had no idea what Kibi's purpose would be when he made her, it turned out more convenient when she taken an interest in helping the other engineers.</li>
