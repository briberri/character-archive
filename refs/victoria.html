            <br><br>Backstory: Being one of the youngest Celestial children,
            Victoria was kidnapped at an early age. The pirates had hoped to sell her off for a high price since she's a goddess. Unfortunately, their ship crash landed on Arcacia. Victoria was then adopted by the royal family and became the ruler of
            Arcacia for a short period of time. She was caught into it's political affairs before being assasinated by a woman who wanted her crown. During this time, Victoria returned to being a deity, and watched over Arcacia. Only one man was able
            to see and communicate with her, and helped her overthrow the Queen. Afterwrads, Arcacians built a shrine for Victoria and praised her as their deity, and gave her offerings as to please her so she would keep the nearby volcanoe dormant.
            <br>Over time, Celest was able to find Victoria and relocate her to the galaxy as the goddess of the stars. 
            <br><br>Personality: Tsundere. Hot-headed with a soft-side. Victoria is pretty handy and likes to fix things herself. A workholic and believes
            that if you want something done right you have to do it yourself. Very independent. Maybe almost too independent.</p>
