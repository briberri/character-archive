        <h1>Shisen</h1>
        <p>


            Species's Name: Shisen
            <br><br>Abilities: Enhanced vision, retrocognition (the power to discern events of the past), divine sight (The ability to see reality from the eyes of a god, goddess or divine, cosmic entity), vision manipulation (The power to manipulate
            the vision of oneself and/or others), chaotic vision (User can see/view into the true chaotic state that makes up existence/reality, allowing them to know how everything in existence comes together and connects, see past any/all falsehoods
            and lies and anything that is normally hidden/obscured/unknown would be laid completely bare to them including the true forms of any/all eldritch and cosmic other creatures/entities)
            <br><br>Diet: Shisen live a simple life without much electronic
            technology, so their diet is pretty simple as well. They eat mostly meat, fruit, veggies, grains, and berries. They enjoy beer and wine when they can, but they don't eat too much sugar or sweets.
            <br><br>Environment: Shisen typically like to live
            in jungles, plains, or near the mountains. They dislike the cold and tend not to settle in cold areas, and prefer places with fertile land to grow food. Shisen villages near jungles have more extravagant and dangerous animals they befriend,
            like tigers or snakes. 
            <br><br>Hierarchy: The only leaders in the community are the elders, who are held in high regard for their worldly knowledge. One leader is selected to make smaller decisions for the village, like trades and checking stock,
            but important laws and judgements go through the elders. 
            <br><br>Weakness: Shisen tend to be physically weak from having so many eyes on their bodies. They try not to strain their bodies too much since the eyes make their tissue very soft. This has
            also kept the Shisen from entering into too many wars, and kept them as mostly peaceful.</p>
            <p>Fun facts:</p>
            
            <ul>
                
                <li>They can be considered "tree huggers", as they care deeply about persevering the planet they live on. They try to be very eco-friendly.</li>
                <li>Shisen are very confident about showing their bodies, they aren't taught any shame in their bodies so they don't have a problem being stark naked in public.</li>
                <li>Shisen don't get tattoos. It could potentially damage their bodies and their eyesight
            permanently.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>They do, however, have tribal markings. These markings are made with a special type of body paint that is rubbed onto the skin. It is usually made by the village doctor to make sure the paint does not irritate the eyes.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Shisen don't bother cutting their hair often.</li>
