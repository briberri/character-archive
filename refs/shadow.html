        <h1>Shadow Demons</h1>
        <p>

            Species's Name: Shadow Demons, Corruption Demons 
            <br><br>Any forms: These demons have no physical means to their bodies, they are able to become a free form and a physical form depending on their stength. all forms have some humanoid appearance to them, but it is also common to see them in the shape of any and all life forms. Their "free form" is the condition their bodies are normally in. This form is best described as foggy, and the shadow demons are seen as black fog or a ghostly form. The
            other form is more solid, and is only used when said demon has enough strength or food. It's rather rare for a shadow demon to have a physical form that can be touched, and signifies that this demon has significant power (or has accumulated
            as much over a period of time). This appearance is more humanoid, but blackened like a silhouette. If injured, the shadow demons will try to revert back into safety somewhere in the shadows, or back to the demon realm, otherwise they may disappear.
            disappear.
            <br><br>Fully physical and human appearances are reserved for the royal shadow demons. They exhibit the most power, as being able to take on a fully human appearance. This being said, they are usually highly respected and treated as the leaders
            of shadow demons. 
            <br>It is also important to note that shadow demons are mostly spotted at night, by those seriously sleep deprived. The beings do wander around in the daytime, when they have the strength, but they usually pretend to be the
            shadow of someone else, and wander around attached to said person. 
            <br><br>Abilities: Most of this species seems passive, and don't display many acts of violence. Besides their appearances, they hold the ability to consume corruption and manipulate
            shadows into some sort of physical object (albeit just the outlined, silhouette version of it). Besides these things, shadow demons exhibit no other known abilities. 
            <br><br>Diet: Shadow Demons rely on the corruption of others as nutrients. They typically
            latch onto a victim and leech off of their corruption. during this time, they become their victim's "shadow", and are attached to them until they no longer feel the need to feed from them. This is the only way shadow demons can roam around
            during the day, as their victim's body blocks any light from their bodies. The stronger a demon is, the less they need to feed. 
            <br><br>Clothing: Shadow demons have little to no interest in wearing clothes, since they aren't usually ashamed of
            their bodies (it's not like you can see anything anyway).Usually the royals wear clothes, and don't have much variance in what they wear.
            <br><br>Environment: Shadow demons reside in the demon realm, their country is squared away on the outskirts
            of the rest of the realm, far away from the other demons. They live remotely, and their land is dangerously close to being a barren wasteland. Most of it was flattened to make room for buidlings and real estate, and most of the surrounding
            animals fled elsewhere. That being said, trading is very popular and profitable, and most commoners become travelers to sell and trade goods. Shadow demons have one of the largest export businesses, as they are close to and built multiple
            ports.
            
            <br><br>Weakness: Light. Light gives them a burning sensation and causes the inflicted area to "dissapear". Usually the victim must return to the demon realm back into darkness to recover, but there are stories of shadow demons being exposed
            fully to light and never being seen from again.
