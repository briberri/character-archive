            <br>Languages spoken: English (native language) French (mastered
            and fluent in) 
            <br>Body marks: None 
            <br>Backstory: As the son of the famous scientist, Shiryoku was renounced for his intelligence in school. He often tried to help his father with his experiments, usually pouring chemicals together or passing him
            his supplies while he worked. During his childhood years, Shiry's father turned his research to medicine, and began small experiements on his son. It slowly grew in his pre-teen years to more intensive research, like injections or consumable
            drugs, which his father showed little regards to the many side effects Shiry had.
            <br><br>By age 15, Shiry attempted to reject his father's experiments, but his father became violent and tied Shiry down in his lab. Shiry lived a few years in that
            laboratory, arms chained above his head, with only a few visits from his father to feed him or escort him to the bathroom. For about two years, Shiry didn't see the light of outside and went mentally numb from the side effects of his father's
            experiments. He lost any sense of time and showed no reactions to recognizing any of his other family members, he didn't even respond to his own name. The only thing that saved him was his brother, who helped him escape after his father became
            ill. Shiry's brother murdered their father while he was bedridden and set Shiry free, getting him to a village before leaving him there. 
            <br><br>Shiry wondered from town to town, homeless. His mind was too far gone to be concerned with even eating
            or bathing, and he finally collapsed in the entrance of another town. He woke up later in an extravagant room, where a young kid seemed to be nursing him back to health. There were mostly other assistants to tend to him, but the kid came in
            often, speaking to him even if he didn't respond. after a bit, Shiry started speaking, even if he hadn't in years, he told the kid that he didn't know his own name, and that he came from his father's lab, he told him both his parents are dead,
            and he doesn't know where his brother is. Eventually, Shiry thanked him, telling him that he owed the kid his life.
            <br><br>After Shiry learned that the kid's name was Fear and he was the leader of the Timorians, he invested all his time into an
            academy for those who wish to become servants to Fear. Shiry trained hard for the next few years, changing his whole demeanor. After graduating, Shiry made sure he was perfect and worked hard to earn the title of head servant. 
            <br><br>Appearance: Shiryoku
            wears his hair slicked back as he feels it looks much more professional. He wears a suit at all times an wears a white apron when cooking or cleaning, so as not to mess it up.
            <br><br>Personality: Shiry is pretty uptight and doesn't know how to have
            fun, he usually only enjoys himself when Fear commands him to. Shiry has dedicated his life to Fear, and subjects himself to whatever Fear wishes him to. Despite being so stoic, Shiryoku is able to express some emotion to Fear (on the rare
            occasion that he does). Other servants speculate that he acts this way because of the after effects of the experimentations, but Shiry's mental health condition has been largely unchecked. 
            <br><br>Special Abilities: Enhanced vision, Retrocognition
            (able to see into one's past upon first glance), mind's eye/third eye, sense inducement (the user can induce sensory effects, causing short-term change in how the target senses the world or adding something that doesn't really exist), shared
            vision (The power to share the visions of an individual's past and present sights).</p>

            <p>Fun facts:</p>
            
            <ul>
                
                <li>Shiryoku was deeply disturbed by his retrocognition ability,
            as he learned everything about a person's past merely by looking at them for the first time, hence why he became so quiet and timid around others. He eventually became so used to it that it doesn't phase him anymore, but he hasn't let anyone,
            not even Fear, about this ability.</li><br>
                <li>Shiry has long forgotten his real name, he allowed Fear to give him the name Shiryoku. Shiry's memory is seriously faded, there are things about himself that he may never remember. Like:</li>
                <ul>
                    
                    <li>no knowledge of
            where his remaining family is or what their names might be</li>
                    <li>he doesn't know when his birth date is</li>
                    <li>he can't remember where his home town is</li>
                    <li>etc</li>
                    
                </ul>
