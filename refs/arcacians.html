        <h1>Arcacians</h1>
        <p>

            Species's Name: Arcacians 
            <br><br>Abilities: Gravity manipulation, limited teleportation, enhanced condition. These are the few powers bestowed upon the Arcacians by the goddess Celest. It is rumored that her intention for them to have these abilities is
            to give them protection, but still not too much power. Limited teleportation - Arcacians can only teleport to an area they have already visited, merely by imagining the place in their mind. 
            <br><br>Diet: Arcacians have healthy diets. They eat
            meat and other farm products they grow, and typically don't eat processed food very much. Normal meals usually include meat, vegetables, fruits, grains.
            <br><br>Environment:
            <br>Spade and Heart Kingdoms tend to have more animals and nature in their countries.
            <br>Diamond is a big tourist site due to the business and city life (and the fashion runway), but is currently trying to solve their pollution problems. Clover is the most rural and normal area, but tends to have many casinos and strip clubs around.
            <br>Due to the lifestyle Clovers like to live, crime is quite high in their area. There's a mean police force in the Clover Kingdom that is beginning to drive tourists away.
            <br><br>Hierarchy: Arcacians are divided into classifications based on suits of cards. Each house has their own land, culture, and kingdom. 
            <br>Ace 
            <br><br>Spade - Spade's are the most old fashioned and ruthless. They are known for their strong military and warfare. Spade was previously the least popular suit, as they frequently
            pillaged and conquered many other lands before the world peace treaty. Many Spades are hired for protection or rented soldiers during warfare, they also thrive on the teachings of martial arts and take religion very seriously. Each town has
            a temple dedicated to the goddess Celest and praise her for the promise of a strong mind, body, and soul. 
            <br><br>Heart - Heart's are known for their agriculture. Their population is low, and the country has very few kingdoms or cities. The Heart
            Kingdom has the largest amount of land, most of it dedicated to farming. Heart's typically have green thumbs and love the countryside. Due to the simple lives they lead, deception, greed, and laziness are deeply frowned upon. 
            <br><br>Diamond - Diamond
            are known for business and entrepreneurship. They love the big city life and love being flashy. Most public and private leaders meet here privately to discuss trades or startup businesses. Diamonds typically live the fast life and love "get
            rich quick" schemes. Diamonds are also known for the fashion runway. They typically are more snobbish, and take fashion and jewelry very seriously. They consider themselves trendsetters and expect everyone else to follow or get left in the
            dust.
            <br><br>Clubs - Casinos. And lots of gambling. Like Diamonds, Clubs like the "get rich quick" idea, but prefer doing it by risking damn near everything they own. They also live the city, fast life. Obviously having luck on their side, they
            get bored easily and can't have fun without finding a thrill in taking a risk and love adrenaline rushes. These thrill-seekers are often troublemakers, and aren't welcome in some other towns. 
            <br>Religion: Each Kingdom has an extravagant temple
            dedicated to the goddess Celest and the god Clade, each town and city also has a temple dedicated to the two dieties, but varying in quality. 
            <br><br>Celest is praised as the creator of all things living, including planets and seperate dimensions.
            She is the goddess of space and time, or so the religion says. Her counterpart and husband is Clade, the god space-time god of destruction. Each god is praised equally and viewed as needed in order to balance one another out. Without each
            other, it is believed that time will stop and space will begin to destroy itself in a black hole. Arcacians currently praise and worship these two beings as their "gods".
            <br>Weakness: As their planet rotates closer to Celest, she is the primary
            energy source for Arcacia. Something like their "sun". When Arcacians are too far away from Celest, they will grow ill and may die if away for too long.</p>
            <p>Fun facts:</p>
            
            <ul>
                
                <li>Due to Arcacia's heavy gravity, most humans will be crushed on this planet.</li>
                <li>Arcacian's "gravity manipulation" is more prominent on other planets, as the gravity is not as heavy. Because of this, Arcacian's hair seems to float around as if there is no gravity around.</li>
