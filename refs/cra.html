        <br>Backstory: Mr. Rhea was a general in the army (and ruler of the shadow demons) and was on his
            return from being stationed in another country when Cra was conceived. At the time, her sister Princess was two years old, and her brother, Reeve, was already off in college. A few months before Mrs. Rhea was due, Cra's father was called off
            for war once again. As much as he didn't want to, he had to leave. 
            <br>A few days before Cra's birthday, her father was pronounced dead, being killed in the last battle. Oishii slipped into a depressive state, and gave birth to Cra while mourning.
            Cra was born with the palest skin and the darkest black hair, similar to her father. She looked exactly like him as a matter of fact, she didn't really look like Oishii at all. After her birth, Oishii widely neglected Cra, only taking care
            of her bare necessities.
            <br>Cra learned pretty quickly to become self-sufficient at a young age. after all, her mother didn't speak to her, look at her, or acknowledge her in any way. Oishii didn't smile anymore and didn't leave the house often.
            Princess lived a much more happier life, receiving her mother's affections freely and getting most of the things she wanted in life, being popular at school and having a lot of friends over all the time. Cra envied her sister a lot, seeing
            as how her only "friend" was her teddy bear her father bought for her before her birth. 
            <br>Shortly after her 17th birthday, Cra's brother, Reeve, sent a letter saying he would visit soon, and offer her a job if she wanted. Reeve didn't catch
            onto the neglect at first, but then just took Cra with him back to the demon realm. There, he introduced her to the organization, where Cra trained for a few years before joining. While Cra is the ruler of the shadow demons, she is only interested
            in ruling for the important decisions that need to be made, otherwise she isn't concerned with staying in the castle and ruling. 
            <br>Personality: Due to her neglect, Cra is often quiet and reserved. She doesn't joke around much and is rather serious.
            She tends to have a sharp tongue and quiet feisty around new people. With friends, she's a bit more kind and helpful. Cra isn't used to attention, but she likes being doted on, acting a bit more shy when someone does it. 
            <br>Cra likes sweets and
            cute things like stuffed animals, but she covers it up by being gothic.
            <br>Special Abilities: Shadow mimicry (The power to transform into or have a physical body made up of shadows), darkness manipulation, umbrakinetic creature creation (the
            power to create beings of darkness or shape them to certain shapes), shadow camouflage (the ability to become invisible while in the shadows).

                <li>Reeve changed Kuuki to be more useful in battle. He alternated his claws and eyes to be more like weapons, and infused
            another unfortunate soul he found to serve Cra in her missions</li>
