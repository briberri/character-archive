            <br>Body marks:Scales on back, tail, thighs, and forearms
            <br>Backstory: Born in Naria, the birthplace for dragons, Uni lived a mostly peaceful childhood. In his early teen years treason was found in the royal family, and as being the son of a duke, Uni was called to be present during the reassessment
            of power. Although ruling over a smaller port in the underworld, Uni was forced to fight for power over his brother, until he realized that becoming the duke wasn't what he really wanted and left for training. During his training, Uni had
            an out-of-body experience where he met Celest, and was consequently offered the role of being the "gatekeeper of the galaxy", or really, the person people must answer to before going to speak with Celest. Uni now lives in the Mirror Limbo,
            where most beings go if they are not yet dead, but in a coma-like state.
            <br>Personality: Uni doesn't get much interaction, so he's rather antisocial. He's serious and a workaholic, and not very emotional. He's indifferent in his relationship with his brother. He's learned to be rather resourceful since spending
            so much time alone and can survive out on his own.
